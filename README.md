Hitman resources - a page for modding resources and a host for QuickMod's Mod Explorer.

# IMPORTANT NOTE

Neither QuickEdit nor this wiki support piracy, accessing always-online content or replaying ETs. Nothing in this repository is intended to allow players access to content they are not normally allowed to access or an unfair advantage over other players. This simply allows players to access existing content in the game and repurpose it to allow for greater replay value in Hitman 2.
